# Diabetes Analysis
>Diabetes is a metabolic diseases that result from the body not having the capacity to convert sugar into glucose to be used for energy. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose(WHO).

>The dataset used for this project is Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle. This original dataset has been provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Both dataset and code for this project are available on my GitHub repository. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get diabetes based on the input parameters like Age, Glucose, Blood pressure, Insulin, BMI, etc. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient. It is to be noted that all patients here are females minimum 21 years old belonging to Pima Indian heritage(Devashree).
What the data is telling us
>Most of the subjects/volunteers have a normal diastolic blood pressure distribution.

> A higher percentage of the volunteers were overweight, although most have a normal blood plasma glucose level afer 2hrs of glucose ingestion, there was a significant amount of prediabetics.

> There is a high number of overweight volunteers that had an outcome of diabetes, although the relationship is not clearly linear, there is a connection. However there was a much greater number of overweights that did not have an outcome of diabetes.

>The number of pregnancies doesn't have a linear relationship with the outcome of diabetes but there are instances where the onset of diabetes is a result of being pregnant, it was more evident when women had a number of pregnancy greater than seven, seven isn't the lucky number again I guess?

>It was discovered that the outcome of diabetics is not particularly increased as a result of advancement in age as it was found that the age group 20-39 had more diabetic outcome compared to other age groups. Looking further it was found that the age group 20-39 had a high distribution of overweight volunteers, this can as well point to outcome of diabetes  being largely dependent on the a higher BMI index irrespective of age.

## Conclusion
> The different factors and predictive measures for a diabetic outcome isn't as reliable as suggested by the analysis of the dataset, however one can not deny the trend and possible link between being overweight and having a possible diabetic outcome. I would say this subjections isn't cast on stone, there is a need to continuing probing data for more definite insights.
